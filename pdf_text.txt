The case of the disappearing teaspoons: longitudinal
cohort study of the displacement of teaspoons in an
Australian research institute
Megan S C Lim, Margaret E Hellard, Campbell K Aitken
Abstract
Objectives To determine the overall rate of loss of
workplace teaspoons and whether attrition and
displacement are correlated with the relative value of
the teaspoons or type of tearoom.
Design Longitudinal cohort study.
Setting Research institute employing about 140
people.
Subjects 70 discreetly numbered teaspoons placed in
tearooms around the institute and observed weekly
over five months.
Main outcome measures Incidence of teaspoon loss
per 100 teaspoon years and teaspoon half life.
Results 56 (80%) of the 70 teaspoons disappeared
during the study. The half life of the teaspoons was 81
days. The half life of teaspoons in communal
tearooms (42 days) was significantly shorter than for
those in rooms associated with particular research
groups (77 days). The rate of loss was not influenced
by the teaspoons’ value. The incidence of teaspoon
loss over the period of observation was 360.62 per
100 teaspoon years. At this rate, an estimated 250
teaspoons would need to be purchased annually to
maintain a practical institute-wide population of 70
teaspoons.
Conclusions The loss of workplace teaspoons was
rapid, showing that their availability, and hence office
culture in general, is constantly threatened.
Introduction
In January 2004 the authors found their tearoom
bereft of teaspoons. Although a flunky (MSCL) was
rapidly dispatched to purchase a new batch, these
replacements in turn disappeared within a few months.
Exasperated by our consequent inability to stir in our
sugar and to accurately dispense instant coffee, we
decided to respond in time honoured epidemiologists’
fashion and measure the phenomenon.
A search of the medical and other scientific
literature
through
Google,
Google
Scholar,
and
Medline using the keywords “teaspoon”, “spoon”,
“workplace”, “loss” and “attrition” revealed nothing
about the phenomenon of teaspoon loss. Lacking any
guidance from previous researchers, we set out to
answer the age old question “Where have all the
bloody teaspoons gone?” We aimed to determine the
overall rate of loss of teaspoons and the half life of tea-
spoons in our institute, whether teaspoons placed in
communal tearooms were lost at a different rate from
teaspoons placed in individual tearooms, and whether
better quality teaspoons would be more attractive to
spoon shifters or be more highly valued and respected
and therefore move and disappear more slowly.
Methods
The Macfarlane Burnet Institute for Medical Research
and
Public
Health
(Burnet
Institute)
based
in
Melbourne, employs about 140 people. The institute
has eight tearooms; four are “programme linked”—that
is, predominantly used by the staff of a single
programme—and four are communal: two are attached
to formal meeting rooms, one is a large multipurpose
staff room, and one is a rather barren corridor with
kitchen facilities.
Pilot study
Between 5 February 2004 and 18 June 2004 we
carried out a pilot study to gain an initial impression
of the manner of teaspoon loss at the institute and to
refine our methods for the full study. We purchased 32
plain stainless steel teaspoons, discreetly numbered
with red nail polish on the undersides of the handles,
and distributed into a subset of the eight tearooms: 16
in the programme linked tearooms and 16 in the
communal tearooms. We carried out a weekly audit
over five months to assess any changes in the distribu-
tion of the teaspoons throughout the institute.
Main study
At the completion of the pilot study we carried out a
longitudinal cohort study. We purchased and num-
bered a further 54 stainless steel teaspoons. In addition
we purchased and discreetly numbered 16 teaspoons
of higher quality. The teaspoons were distributed
(stratified
by
spoon
type)
throughout
the
eight
tearooms, with a higher proportion allocated to those
tearooms with the highest teaspoon losses in the pilot
study.
We carried out counts of the teaspoons weekly for
two months then fortnightly for a further three
months. Desktops
and
other
immediately
visible
surfaces were scanned for errant spoons.
After five months we revealed our previously cov-
ert research project to the institute’s staff. They were
asked to return or anonymously report any marked
teaspoons that had made their way into desk drawers
or homes. Two days after the revelation, staff were
asked to complete a brief anonymous questionnaire,
which
dealt
with
their
attitudes
towards
and
knowledge of teaspoons and teaspoon theft.

Results
After five months, 56 (80%) of 70 teaspoons had disap-
peared. The half life of the teaspoons was 81 days (that
is, half had disappeared permanently after that time)
compared with 63 days in the pilot study. The type of
tearoom in which spoons were initially placed did
affect the rate of loss. The amount of time a teaspoon
survived
in
its
final
room
did,
however,
vary
significantly according to final tearoom type: half life
42 days for communal rooms (observed 28, expected
20.5) and 77 days for programme linked rooms
(observed 57, expected 64.5, P < 0.05; fig 1). The rate of
loss of the higher quality teaspoons (observed 12,
expected 12.4) was not significantly different to that of
standard quality teaspoons (observed 44, expected
43.6, P = 0.88; fig 2).
We observed the teaspoons for a total of 5668
teaspoon days. The rate of teaspoon loss over the
period of observation was 0.99 per 100 teaspoon days
(95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.28), or 360.62 per
100 teaspoon years. Assuming an average daily
population
of
140
people
in
the
institute, this
translates to a rate of loss of 2.58 teaspoons per
person per 100 teaspoon years. Therefore to maintain
a workable population (one spoon for every two
people) 252.4 (194.3 to 328) teaspoons would need be
purchased every year.
If we assume that the annual rate of teaspoon loss
per employee can be applied to the entire workforce of
the city of Melbourne (about 2.5 million), an estimated
18 million teaspoons are going missing in Melbourne
each year. Laid end to end, these lost teaspoons would
cover over 2700 km—the length of the entire coastline
of Mozambique
1—and weigh over 360 metric tons—the
approximate weight of four adult blue whales.
2
After the revelation of the study to the institute’s
staff, five potentially lost teaspoons were recovered
from miscreant hoarders. Four of these were returned
from areas far removed from their place of last obser-
vation; one had been missing for 20 weeks. No one
admitted to the permanent removal of a teaspoon
from the institute, and no plausible explanations were
advanced for the high rate of teaspoon loss.
Follow-up questionnaire
Overall, 94 employees (response rate 67%) responded
to the follow-up questionnaire. Thirty six (38%) were
male, 57 were female (61%), and one was undecided.
The table shows selected results.
Discussion
Displacement of teaspoons outside tearooms at the
Burnet Institute, Australia, was highly efficient, at the
rate of nearly one teaspoon lost per 100 teaspoon days.
Despite
the
purchase
of
substantial
numbers
of
replacement teaspoons during the study period, most
employees (73%) remained dissatisfied with teaspoon
coverage in the institute.

Although the scientific literature is strangely bereft
of teaspoon related research, the phenomena we have
described are capable of interpretation using some
well known theoretical perspectives. For example, in
his classic essay The tragedy of the commons,
3 Garrett
Hardin describes the destruction of commons (grazing
land open for all local cattle herders to use) owing to
individual herders grazing extra cattle at the expense
of their community. If every herder takes the same
approach, eventually the commons is completely over-
grazed and useless to everyone.
The tragedy of the commons applies equally well to
teaspoons. In the Burnet Institute the commons
consists of a communally owned set of teaspoons; tea-
spoon users (consciously or otherwise) make decisions
that their own utility is improved by removing a
teaspoon for personal use, whereas everyone else’s
utility is reduced by only a fraction per head (“after all,
there are plenty more spoons . . .”). As more and more
teaspoon users make the same decision, the teaspoon
commons
is
eventually
destroyed. The
fact
that
teaspoons were lost significantly more rapidly from the
Burnet Institute’s communal tearooms (the “com-
mons”) compared with programme linked rooms, cor-
relates neatly with Hardin’s principle.
We propose a somewhat more speculative theory
(with apologies to Douglas Adams and Veet Voojagig).
Somewhere in the cosmos, along with all the planets
inhabited by humanoids, reptiloids, walking treeoids,
and superintelligent shades of the colour blue, a planet
is entirely given over to spoon life-forms. Unattended
spoons make their way to this planet, slipping away
through space to a world where they enjoy a uniquely
spoonoid
lifestyle,
responding
to
highly
spoon
oriented stimuli, and generally leading the spoon
equivalent of the good life.
4
Our data might also be contemplated through the
prism of counterphenomenological resistentialism,
which holds that les choses sont contre nous (things are
against us).
5 Resistentialism is the belief that inanimate
objects have a natural antipathy towards humans, and
therefore it is not people who control things but things
that increasingly control people. Although it seems
unreasonable to say that the teaspoons are exerting
any influence over the Burnet Institute’s employees
(with the exception of the authors), their demonstrated
ability to migrate and disappear shows that we have
little or no control over them.
Future studies investigating the pattern of move-
ment and loss of other types of cutlery or other equip-
ment (perhaps even more expensive or important than
teaspoons) could provide a broader picture of the phe-
nomenon under study. Microchipping and satellite
tracking systems would have enabled determination of
the
teaspoons’
ultimate
location
(assuming
they
remained on planet Earth).
We have no reason to believe that beverage
production or consumption or any other teaspoon
related activities at the Burnet Institute are significantly
different from that occurring at other medical research
institutions, or indeed any other similar sized organisa-
tion; thus we believe our results are widely applicable.
Conclusions
The
high
level
of
dissatisfaction
with
teaspoon
coverage identified in our follow-up survey shows that
teaspoons
are
an
essential
part
of
office
life.
Simultaneously, the rapid rate of teaspoon loss shows
that their availability (and therefore office life) is under
constant assault. Teaspoon displacement and loss
leads to the use of forks, knives, and staplers to meas-
ure
out
coffee
and
sugar,
inevitably
causing
a
reduction in employee satisfaction; in addition, large
amounts
of
time
may
be
wasted
searching
for
teaspoons,
both
factors
leading
to
decreased
employee
efficiency.
The
cost
of
maintaining
a
workable teaspoon population, estimated at nearly
$A100 (£43; $75; €63) a year for the study setting
alone, must also be considered. We recommend that
new institutes design their facilities so that pro-
gramme linked tearooms predominate over commu-
nal tearooms and that existing institutes consider
renovations to reduce the risk of teaspoon loss. We
also advise that buying teaspoons of higher quality has
no economic benefit. Finally, we suggest that the
development of effective control measures against the
loss of teaspoons should be a priority on national
research agendas.
We thank the employees of the Burnet Institute for their unwit-
ting participation in this project and for the vigorous debate that
followed
its
revelation
(particularly
Tony
Stewart);
those
employees who were aware of the study and contributed to its
design
and
conduct—Steve
Wesselingh, Ian
Cooke, Greg
Battistella, and staff from the Centre for Epidemiology and
Population Health Research; Andrew Symon for help with data
collection, Jane Hocking for help with statistical analysis, Nick
Crofts for introducing us to the delights of resistentialism, and
WSM Summerskill for calling the biroid phenomenon to our
attention.

What is already known on this topic
Information on the displacement of teaspoons in
institutional settings is lacking in the medical and
scientific literature
What this study adds
We lost nearly one teaspoon per 100 teaspoon
days
People have no control over teaspoon migration;
escape to a spoonoid planet and resistentialism
are equally plausible explanations
